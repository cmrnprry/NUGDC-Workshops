# NUGDC-Workshops

This will be the offical/unoffical github for all NUGDC workshop tutorials! Any code or projects that we demo will be uploading in their finished state here! Any slides or documentaion will be posted in a google folder (will instert link here when it exists). All projects will be pushed to their own branches on the github, as well as the master branch. So if you only want to see one specific tutorial, you won't have a project that's clogged with all our tutorials :)

  - Type ```gh repo clone cmrnprry/NUGDC-Workshops```
    - This will clone the Repo to your machine
  - The folder where it's saved is now where the project lives!
  
    **Switching Branches:**
    - Type ```git branch``` to get a list of all the branches on the repo
    - Type ```git checkout [branchname]``` to switch to the branch you want to be on
      - Example: If the branch name is Enemy-AI, you would type ```git checkout Enemy-AI```
